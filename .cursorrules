# Flutter Best Practices

## General Flutter Best Practices
- Use the latest stable version of Flutter and dependencies.
- Organize your project structure with clear separation of features.
- Don't dupplicate the code
- Utilize the `flutter pub outdated` command to keep dependencies updated.
- Implement state management solutions like Riverpod or Provider effectively.
- Use Flutter's built-in widgets for better performance and consistency.

## Flutter Riverpod Best Practices
- Use `Provider` for dependency injection and state management.
- Prefer `StateNotifier` for managing complex state logic.
- Utilize `ScopedProvider` for localized state management.
- Avoid using `Provider` directly in the widget tree; use `Consumer` or `ConsumerWidget` instead.
- Keep your providers organized and modular for better maintainability.

## Flutter Secure Storage Best Practices
- Use `flutter_secure_storage` for sensitive data storage.
- Always encrypt sensitive data before storing it.
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations.
- Regularly review and update your storage strategy as per security best practices.
- Use platform-specific implementations for enhanced security.

## Go Router Best Practices
- Use `GoRouter` for declarative routing in your Flutter app.
- Define routes in a centralized location for better maintainability.
- Utilize nested routes for complex navigation structures.
- Implement route guards for authentication and authorization.
- Keep your route definitions clean and well-documented.

## Google Sign-In Best Practices
- Use the latest version of `google_sign_in` for security updates.
- Implement proper error handling for sign-in failures.
- Store user credentials securely using `flutter_secure_storage`.
- Ensure compliance with Google's policies for user data handling.
- Test sign-in flows on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Internationalization Best Practices
- Use the `intl` package for localization and formatting.
- Define all strings in a centralized localization file.
- Use `Intl.message` for dynamic strings to support multiple languages.
- Regularly update localization files as your app evolves.
- Test your app in different locales to ensure proper formatting and translations.

## Socket.IO Best Practices
- Use `socket_io_client` for real-time communication.
- Implement reconnection logic for better reliability.
- Handle socket events and errors gracefully.
- Keep your socket connection logic modular and reusable.
- Test socket connections under various network conditions.

## Testing Best Practices
- Use the `test` package for unit and widget testing.
- Write tests for all critical business logic and UI components.
- Use `mockito` for mocking dependencies in tests.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for structuring tests.
- Regularly run tests in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.
